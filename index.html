      <h3>Ezekiel 25:17</h3>
      <a
        ><q
          >The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities
          of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
          name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
          of the darkness. For he is truly his brotherâ€™s keeper and the finder
          of lost children.<br />
          And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
          anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you
          will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.</q
